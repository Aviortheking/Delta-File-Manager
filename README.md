## Icons

I used the icons from [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com) (Github link: [Github](https://github.com/feathericons/feather)) licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/blob/master/LICENSE)

## issues

- Actually we need to manually delete three lines from the package nunjuck loader to be able to run the dev server (index.js #21-23)
